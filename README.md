# AI Video Generation Tool

A comprehensive Next.js application for generating high-quality AI videos for web project hero sections and other creative needs. Built because I needed a reliable tool to create AI videos for different web projects, so I created my own multi-provider solution.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I was working on multiple web projects and needed high-quality AI-generated videos for hero sections, but existing solutions were either too expensive, limited, or unreliable. So I built my own tool that supports **4 different AI video generation providers** with a **smart, adaptive interface** that gives me:

- **Flexibility**: Choose the best provider for each project's needs and budget
- **Cost Control**: Compare real-time pricing and use the most cost-effective option
- **No Confusion**: UI automatically shows only the features each provider actually supports
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new providers as they become available
- **Professional Results**: Access to the latest models from Google, OpenAI, RunwayML, and more

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 **4 AI Video Providers**
Choose from the best video generation services with **smart capability-based UI**:

- **VEO3 API** - Advanced features with audio generation ($0.08/sec) - **Primary Provider**
- **RunwayML Gen-4** - Professional quality with camera controls ($0.05/sec)
- **Luma Dream Machine** - Character consistency & realistic physics ($0.02/sec)
- **OpenAI Sora** - Exceptional quality for complex scenes ($0.10/sec)

> **Note**: Pika Labs 2.2 is temporarily disabled while awaiting API access approval.

### 🧠 **Smart Adaptive Interface**
- **Dynamic Controls**: UI automatically shows/hides options based on provider capabilities
- **Auto-Validation**: Values adjust automatically when switching providers
- **Capability-Aware**: Only shows supported features (aspect ratios, durations, etc.)
- **Real-time Cost Estimation**: Accurate pricing based on actual provider limits

### 🎯 **Advanced Video Generation**
- **Multiple Aspect Ratios**: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:3, 21:9 support (provider-dependent)
- **Image-to-Video**: Upload reference images for better results
- **Negative Prompts**: Specify what you don't want in your videos
- **Batch Generation**: Create multiple video variations (where supported)
- **Resolution Control**: 720p, 1080p, 4K options (provider-dependent)
- **Frame Rate Control**: 24, 30, 60 FPS options (provider-dependent)
- **Smart Duration Selection**: Dropdown for fixed durations, input for flexible ones

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Add your API keys for the providers you want to use:
   ```bash
   # Choose your providers (you don't need all of them)
   VEO3_API_KEY=veo_your-veo3-api-key-here      # For VEO3 (Primary Provider)
   RUNWAYML_API_KEY=your-runwayml-api-key-here  # For RunwayML Gen-4
   LUMA_API_KEY=your-luma-api-key-here           # For Luma Dream Machine
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here      # For OpenAI Sora
   
   # Pika Labs 2.2 is temporarily disabled (awaiting API access)
   # PIKA_API_KEY=your-pika-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
